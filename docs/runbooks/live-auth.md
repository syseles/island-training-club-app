# Live Auth — Operational Runbook

This runbook covers the day-to-day operations of the live Supabase auth +
identity + admin panel + approval workflow stack on `feature/auth-identity`.

## Vercel env vars

Set in the Vercel project settings → Environment Variables:

- `SUPABASE_URL` — the project URL (e.g. `https://xyz.supabase.co`).
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — the project's anon key, safe to ship to the browser.

After updating env vars, redeploy. The placeholder values in `app/index.html`
are only used when no env vars are injected.

## Local development

For local dev, edit `app/index.html`'s inline `<script>` block to set
`window.SUPABASE_URL` and `window.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to your dev Supabase
project's values. Refresh the page after changes.

## First-sign-in caveat

The first Google sign-in on the live deployment becomes `super_admin`.
The owner must be literally first. If anyone else signs in first, recover
with:

```sql
update public.profiles
   set role = 'super_admin'
 where email = 'syselesli@gmail.com';
```

## Promote a second admin

Two paths:

- Via the admin panel: a super_admin signs in → `/admin/users` → find the
  member → **Promote to admin**. The DB trigger logs the change in
  `role_changes` automatically.
- Via SQL (when no super_admin exists yet):

```sql
update public.profiles
   set role = 'admin'
 where email = '<email>';
```

## Backfill profiles

If the trigger is added after some users already exist, run once:

```sql
insert into public.profiles (id, email, full_name, avatar_url, role)
select u.id, u.email,
       u.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name',
       u.raw_user_meta_data->>'avatar_url',
       'pending'
  from auth.users u
 where not exists (select 1 from public.profiles p where p.id = u.id);
```

## Inspect audit log

```sql
select p.email, rc.old_role, rc.new_role, rc.reason, rc.created_at
from public.role_changes rc
join public.profiles p on p.id = rc.profile_id
order by rc.created_at desc;
```

## Inspect pending applications

```sql
select p.email, a.mobile, a.date_of_birth, a.is_minor, a.submitted_at
from public.applications a
join public.profiles p on p.id = a.profile_id
where p.role = 'pending'
order by a.submitted_at;
```

## Tear down and reseed the local project

```bash
supabase db reset                 # drops everything; replays migrations
supabase db push                  # pushes migrations to remote
```

## Edit placeholder copy

Until the ITC leadership workshop fills in the policy text, placeholder
copy lives in:

- `app/js/views.js` — `applyFormHtml()` (waiver / privacy / guidelines
  checkbox labels).
- `supabase/migrations/20260804000002_audit_notifications.sql` — the
  welcome notification title and body inside `record_role_change()`.

To update the welcome notification on already-deployed databases:

```sql
update public.notifications
   set body = '<new body text>'
 where kind = 'welcome' and read_at is null;
```

## Migrations

All schema lives in `supabase/migrations/` and is replayed in order by
`supabase db push`. Never edit a migration after it has been applied to
a shared environment — add a new one instead.

## ⏳ Awaiting ITC leadership workshop

The following copy is placeholdered until the workshop lands:

- Waiver acceptance text.
- Privacy policy text.
- Community guidelines text.
- Welcome notification body.
- Approval criteria wording (plausible, non-abusive).
- Hong Kong phone regex in `app/js/store.js` `saveMyApplication`.

The data model supports the real text from day one. Updating the text is
a small SQL or HTML edit per the Edit-placeholder-copy section above.
