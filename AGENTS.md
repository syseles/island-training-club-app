# AGENTS.md

Working notes for AI coding agents working in this repository.
Read `README.md` and `docs/handoff.md` first for product context.

## What this repo is

A clickable, vanilla-JS prototype for the Island Training Club (Hong Kong) community web app. **Pre-production.** No real backend, no build, no framework. The `/app` directory is the prototype; the production stack is still an open decision.

The point of the prototype is to refine flows, copy, and visuals — not to ship.

## Stack

- Plain ES modules. No bundler. No npm runtime deps.
- State is held in `localStorage`; `app/js/store.js` is the single seam where a real backend will later connect.
- All UI is rendered by hand from `app/js/views.js` (string-template HTML).
- Smoke tests live in `app/smoke.mjs` and run headless with `node`.

## Repo layout

## Branching model

Four long-lived branches. Agents must preserve the dedicated Shop split.

- `main` — core app work, including Home, Schedule, Profile, Community, Admin, identity, bookings, and **Giving**.
- `testing` — pre-`main` integration and acceptance for core app and Giving changes.
- `feature/shop-page` — **dedicated Shop work only.** Merchandise, product imagery, product catalog/cart, and anything tied to a future Shop tab. Giving is not Shop work.
- `development` — legacy integration branch (rarely used).

The dedicated Shop split is a hard rule. Merchandise or Shop-tab changes must not land on `main` or `testing`; core app and Giving changes must not use `feature/shop-page`.

When creating a new branch:
- Merchandise / product catalog / cart / dedicated Shop tab / product imagery → `feature/shop-page`
- Giving and anything else → base on `main`

## Local dev

```sh
python3 -m http.server 4173
# then open http://127.0.0.1:4173/app/
```

Manual smoke check after every change:

```sh
node app/smoke.mjs
```

All tests must pass before declaring done. The smoke suite covers the product rules (free vs paid, booking, donor ID, indemnity, Profile sub-pages, leader approval, localStorage migrations). It runs in milliseconds; no excuses.

## Local state and administrative testing

Local state starts empty. Applying through the membership flow creates a pending profile on the current device, which can sign in again by email without a password.

Administrative testing requires Supabase live mode or the historical `archive/demo` branch. The archive is for demonstration only and must not be used as a production source branch.

## The Store.js seam

`app/js/store.js` is the only place that touches `localStorage`. Two non-obvious rules:

1. **Never delete `state` keys without a migration.** Persisted state has a `version` field; bump `STATE_VERSION` and add a migration step in `migrate()` instead of removing data outright.
2. **Seed data is read-only.** Admin edits live in `state`, not in `SEED_*` constants. Resetting local data must rebuild `state` from the seeds.

## Things deliberately NOT in the prototype

Don't accidentally build these into the prototype:

- Real payments (the card form is a stub — any number works)
- Real email / notifications
- A service worker / cache layer (would fight the refinement loop)
- Production-ready waiver / privacy / guidelines copy
- A real backend

When in doubt: is this a real product feature, or a prototype affordance? If the latter, keep it small and clearly mocked.

## Common pitfalls

- **Don't add merchandise or dedicated Shop-tab code to `main`.** Giving is a core `main` feature; catalog, cart, products, and merchandise remain isolated on `feature/shop-page`.
- **Don't break localStorage migrations.** Bump `STATE_VERSION` and add a migration step. Snapshots in `state.bookings` reference seed activity fields by name; renaming them silently breaks old persisted data.
- **Title-cased headings on Profile sub-pages.** "Membership Details", "Donor Profile", "Payments & Receipts", "Privacy & Notifications" — "History" stays single-word.
- **"My Week" on Home is signed-in-only and shows booked sessions.** Visitors see the upcoming preview, not "My Week".
- **The Wednesday Night Training session is free and open to walk-ins.** Approved members may optionally RSVP for the attendee list; there is no checkout, payment, or capacity.
- **The smoke test is the contract.** When you change product behaviour, update the test in the same commit. Don't leave the test failing.

## Style

- Vanilla JS, no transpilation. Use `const`/`let`, arrow functions, template literals, optional chaining.
- New view functions go in `views.js` as `export function viewX()` returning a string.
- New state actions go in `store.js` as `export function actionX()` returning the new state.
- New seed data goes in `data.js`. Anything admin-mutable lives in `state`, not in seeds.
- Keep CSS class names consistent with the existing palette (`.card`, `.kicker`, `.badge`, `.display`, `.btn`, `.muted`, `.section-head`).

## Out of scope for agents

- Don't add npm dependencies.
- Don't introduce a build step.
- Don't restructure the repo layout.
- Don't replace `views.js` with a framework.
- Don't change the localStorage shape without a migration.
